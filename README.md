# SpirtDL2
SpirtDL, but a different language

Does SpirtDL not work for you? You're in the right place.

Download spirtdl.bat, place on your desktop. (DO NOT HAVE CSGO RUNNING)
Double click it. It will auto close steam, and download the loader to C:/spirt.exe, then run the loader. Spirtdl.bat should auto close once you click OK on the successful injection popup. 

(OPTIONAL) Then, download steam.bat and place on your desktop. 

If you do, you can just double click that bat file to run csgo. or you can just click the game icon, same thing.

Make an issue if you need an explanation on what something is or if I can do something better.
